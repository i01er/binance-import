# binance-import for Gekko
A tool for importing binance exchange information to Gekko, an open source crypto trading bot.

This is a self-project, I mainly build it for personal use.

## Gekko
For details about Gekko please visit [gekko repo](https://github.com/askmike/gekko). Gekko is not maintained anymore, *use it at your own risk*.

## Install
You need to have Python on you machine.

1. copy this project to your machine by running `git clone`

```git clone https://github.com/i01er/binance-import.git```

2. run binance-update.py

```python binance-update.py```

3. copy the output file `binance-markets.json` to replace the original one at `gekko/exchange/wrappers/`
